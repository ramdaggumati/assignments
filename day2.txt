1. Document Object:
   - The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the current browser window or frame.
   - It provides properties and methods to interact with the content of the document, such as accessing elements, modifying their attributes, or manipulating their content.
   - Examples of operations you can perform with the document object include accessing elements by their IDs or classes, modifying the content of elements, adding or removing elements, handling events, etc.

2. Window Object:
   - The window object represents the browser window or frame itself.
   - It acts as a global object for the JavaScript code running within that window, providing access to various properties and methods related to the browser window and its behavior.
   - The window object encompasses the entire browser window and includes properties like window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, window.location, etc.
   - It also serves as the global scope for JavaScript in a browser environment, meaning variables and functions declared globally are attached to the window object.

Difference:
- While the document object represents the HTML document loaded in the current window, the window object represents the browser window itself.
- The document object is a property of the window object. So, window.document refers to the same object as document. However, document can be used directly without referencing window.
